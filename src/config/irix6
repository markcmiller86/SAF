	# NOT DOING THIS (TURNING OFF WARNINGS) ANYMORE AS OF 30jan02
	# Always turn off these compiler warnings for the -64 compiler:
	#    1174:  function declared but not used
	#    1429:  the `long long' type is not standard
	#    1209:  constant expressions
	#           This happens in SSlib a *lot* because certain macros return one of two alternatives based on an argument
	#           that is sometimes (but not always) constant. For instance, SS_PERS_ISNULL() takes a pointer and returns true
	#           if the pointer is null or if what it points to is a null link.  So passing the address of a variable will
	#           result in this warning since the variable is known to always have an address.
	#    1196:  __vfork() (this is an SGI config problem)
	#           Oops! This hides missing function prototypes.
	#    1548:  transfer of control bypasses variable initialization
	#           This happens in SSlib a *lot* because the SS_ENTER macro has a `goto _leave'.  There is currently no
	#           known way for the uninitialized variable to be referenced since all code before the goto and after the
	#           _leave label is generated from macros.
	#    1685:  turn off warnings about turning off invalid warnings
	#    1035:  "this header file is to be used only for c99 mode"
	#           Current (1.7.22) versions of HDF5 include <stdint.h> even though HDF5 claims to be c89 compliant.  There
	#           is nothing SAF/SSlib can do about this short of simply turning off the warning until HDF5 is fixed.
