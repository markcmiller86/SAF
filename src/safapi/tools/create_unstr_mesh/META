# This file serves as an example mkdoc configuration file in addition to being the configuration file for the SAF Library
# Reference Manual. Therefore, use lots of comments! A comment is intruduced by a hash `#' and continues to the end of the line,
# but comments are not recognized inside arguments. An argument is anything between curly braces and must not contain curly
# braces itself.  Arguments always appear after keywords that are introduced with a `@' character. The keyword must immediately
# follow the `@' but otherwise white-space is irrelevant outside arguments.

#@corder{Introduction}



#
# Sometimes projects use prologue tags that serve the same purpose as one of mkdoc's tags but don't have the name that
# mkdoc expects.  Rewrite rules can be used in that case, where the first argument is the name used by the project and the
# second argument is the corresponding mkdoc name.  The special value `__NAME__' can appear as the first argument, which
# simply means that the object name can be used as a prologue tag (e.g., for a function named `foo', the prologue may contain
# a tag called `foo' which will be mapped to some other mkdoc tag.
#
@rewrite{__NAME__}{Purpose}

#
# The documentation may contain graphics, and the `figdir' directive tells mkdoc where to look to find the files mentioned in the
# source code while `navdir' says where to look for graphics used for navigation buttons and backgrounds. Relative names are
# with respect to the location of the configuration file in which they appear.
#
@figdir{../../../../docs/manuals/figures/library}
@navdir{../../../../tools/Formats/library/}

#
# If the source code contains variables of the form `$FOO' then mkdoc can substitute values for them before parsing the source
# file.
#
@substitute{SAFDOC}{http://www.engsci.sandia.gov/saf/current}

#
# The default audience for which to produce output.  This directive can appear more than once and results in broadening
# the scope of the documentation. Any object that has one of the specified audiences listed in its documentation comment
# will be included in the output. The special audience `all' means every object is included. See the `-A' command-line
# switch for details.
#
@audience{public}                       # `public' is not the default, rather `all'

#
# Mkdoc is capable of generating different formats of documentation. The default is HTML.  See the `-f' command-line switch
# for details.
#
# @doctype{html}                        # commented out because it's often specified on the command-line

#
# This directive tells mkdoc what to document. See the `-d' command-line switch for details.
#
@document{-prototypes}

#
# Certain sections of an object's documentation can be omitted from the final output. For instance, end users probably don't care
# about modification histories. See the `-E' command-line switch for details.
#
@exclude{modifications}

#
# If source documentation is incomplete then turning on mkdoc's limp-along mode might produce something useful. See the
# `-l' command-line switch for details.  This directive can take an argument which has the same format as the command-line
# switch.
#
# @limpalong{audience=limpalong}        # commented out because it results in lots of warnings

#
# Determines the name of the file or directory that will receive the output. One normally doesn't set this in the
# config file.  See the `-o' command-line switch for details.
#
# @output{index}                        # commented out because it's usually specified on the command-line

#
# Source files can be listed on the command-line or in some other file(s). This directive may appear more than once and
# specifies one list file per occurrence.
#
@sources{/dev/null}

#
# These have the same meanings as their equivalent command-line switches. A slight bug exists in that if one of these is
# specified in the config file there is no way to override it from the command-line.
